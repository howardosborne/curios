<p>Let’s go for a wander around the elegant any yet vibrant resort.

<h2 id="change-trains-with-a-swim-2k-blue">Change trains with a swim (2k blue)</h2>
<p>If you are changing trains at San Sebastian on your way to Bilbao, you may need to go from the mainline (Donostia-San Sebastian) station to the Euskotren station (Amara Donostia). Here’s a route that takes you via the La Concha beach.</p>

<p>By the way, there are changing rooms, lockers and showers (2.50 Euros) so why not go for a swim? If you have forgotten your swimwear, there are plenty of places to pick up some trunks (including Decathlon marked on the map)</p>

<p>Leave the station and cross the majestic Maria Cristina bridge in front of the station. Continue along the road to a roundabout where you should see the Cathedral spire in front of you. Walk towards it and around and to the front of the Cathedral. This leads to a pedestrianised street (Loiola Kalea) and we can follow this road all the way to the beach.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the roads here are in a grid pattern so it should be hard to get completely lost if you fancy going off-piste and having a wander.</p>

<p>There’s the San Martin covered market on the way if you want to pick up a picnic for the beach. However, if you’re not a fan of sand in your sandwiches, there are plenty of places en-route to pick up some pintxos.</p>

<p>Continue to the end where you will emerge on to Alderdi Eder park which backs on to the promenade and your first views of shell-shaped La Concha beach.</p>

<p>If you would like to see more of the old town and head for the hills and some great views, follow the red path below.</p>

<p>Otherwise, turn left and follow the promenade past the watery statue of Don Quixote with his buddy Sancho, or take the ramp down on to the beach.</p>

<p>The changing rooms (with showers and lockers) are towards the middle of the bay by the clock towers.</p>

<p>If you have the time and inclination, you can walk along the beach to the next sweep of sand, Ondarreta beach, where you can hire canoe’s and can paddle out to Santa Clara Island.</p>

<p>When you have had finished building your sandcastle and are ready to head back, make for the clock towers and take Marques Miraflores Kalea through Zaragoza Plaza and turn left on to Arrasate Kalea.</p>

<p>Turn right on to Easo Kalea and follow the road all the way to Amara Donostia station.</p>

<h2 id="old-town-and-high-ground-add-on-4k-red">Old town and high ground add-on (4k red)</h2>
<p>walk along promenade and between the city hall and the ship-shaped nautical club as far as the stone gateway to the old town (Portaletas) and go through it on to Portu Kalea. There are several nice pintxos bars along here which are very popular with tourists.</p>

<p>Turn left down Calle Mayor (Kale Nagusia in Basque) - you’ll know which street to take as it has a majestic basilica at the end (Koruko Andre Mariaren basilika).</p>

<p>At the end of the street, turn left for a hike get some great views. We’ll be coming back this way so if you want to stay on the level or you’re short of time, just turn right.</p>

<p>Go up the steps and at the end of the street, follow the signposted path to the right this will lead up to the medieval castle.</p>

<p>At the top you can take the path down the other side for some different views of the town and the path down leads back to the basilica. Around the back of the hill is the evokative English Cemetery.</p>

<p>When you are back in front of the Basilica, turn right (facing the Basilica)  to continue along de Agosto Kalea to the end. the church of San Vincente/San Bizente, which is worth a nosey around. Walk either way around the church and turn right on to San Juan Kalea and continue down this road past Betxa covered market, where you could pick up some provisions for your onward journey.</p>

<p>The market backs on to a wide tree-lined boulevard (Alameda del Boulevard) which leads down to the City Hall which we passed earlier. Carry straight on along Legazpi Kalea which leads to Gipuzkoa Plaza. A nice little plaza/park containing a monumental weather-station and a monument to José María Usandizaga - a promising Basque composer who died of tuberculosis at 28. The grand building on the right is the regional council offices (Diputación Foral de Guipúzcoa) which is also pretty fancy on the inside, if you fancy a nosey.</p>

<p>Continue along the same path which becomes Idiakez Kalea and then Bergara Kalea. The road bends to the right becoming Prim Kalea and continue along here until you reach the floral roundabout of De Bilbao Plaza that we saw when we arrived. Turn left and you will see the Maria Cristina bridge which leads to the mainline (and bus) station</p>

<h2 id="surfs-and-pintxos-up-in-gros-3k-green">Surf’s (and pintxos) up in Gros (3k green)</h2>
<p>This stroll takes in another side of San Sebastian, the more down-to-earth district of Gros, where the sea comes with big waves (topped with surfers) and tasty pintxos.</p>

<p>Leave the mainline railway (and bus) station and follow the promenade to the right along the riverfront. This leads all the way to the sea past the Kursaal concert hall. Then walk along the beach or seafront.</p>

<p>If you have time (and the inclination), you could hire a board or even get a surfing lesson.</p>

<p>The most photogenic sunset views are from the far end or up the hill. If you want a really good view, then you could follow a part of (one of) the Santiago de Compostella pilgrimage route(s). The trail is well signposted and marked on the interactive map in orange.</p>

<p>From here on, the main attraction is pintxos - I’ve marked some places on the map but feel free to follow your nose rather than the route. Before setting out, you might want to get the pintxos app or visit the website: https://pintxos.es/</p>

<p>Leave the seafront by taking Segundo Izpizua Kalea (next to the palm trees) and continue down the street and follow the course of the striking copper apartments on your right which will lead you on to San Fransico Kalea.</p>

<p>For a couple of interesting places, turn left on to Bermingham Kalea and then right on to General Artetxe Kalea and then right as you enter Naffaroa Plaza turn right and then right again on to Gran Vía Kalea which opens out into De Cataluña Plaza. Walk down the left hand side of the square and at the church of San Ignazio turn left onto Padre Larroca Kalea which you can follow all the way to the end.</p>

<p>Turn right onto Mirakruz Kalea and follow this road all the way to the river where we turn right and get back to the station.</p>
